Against all odds — a federal “war on drugs,” countless misinformation campaigns misrepresenting the dangers of marijuana, and bureaucratic hurdles at every turn — the marijuana industry continues to grow and thrive. This </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/resources/3052013829132756857467.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rupture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between state and federal policy remains one of the root causes stalling further progress within the medical marijuana movement and has resulted in an environment that makes it virtually impossible for legal, legitimate medical marijuana cultivators to advertise their product by any conventional standards. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies like Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, and Google all have their </span><a href="https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/6014299?hl=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">own policies </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">banning the advertisement of so-called “illicit products.” The bans in advertising and promotion, for the most part, are quite far-reaching. Google, for example, states that they “don’t allow the promotion of some products or services that cause damage, harm, or injury.” Not only does Google forbid the promotion of marijuana, its extracts or any other form of consumable marijuana based-products, but also the promotion of vaporizers, pipes, bongs or any other alternative mode of consumption for medical marijuana patients.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite these obstacles, the medical marijuana industry continues to thrive and has </span><a href="http://qz.com/668154/facing-red-tape-online-marijuana-companies-are-inventing-a-totally-new-breed-of-advertising/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">become a pioneer in innovating new methods of advertising.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Indeed, marijuana revenues topped $3 billion last year alone and are expected to double by 2020. For these reasons, different cultivators and advocates are hoping to create more national brand recognition, and many are well on their way.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take the </span><a href="https://www.quantcast.com/p-8p-p7hkcWNjJm#trafficCard"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MANTIS Ad Network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example. What started as one publication, Medical Jane, quickly grew into an advertising juggernaut when the proprietors realized just how difficult it would be to advertise by conventional standards. By forging alliances with other medical marijuana companies, publications, and other industry stakeholders, MANTIS now publishes ads in over 250 mostly marijuana-related websites. The strategy is clearly working, as MANTIS boasts having over 12 million unique visitors in the past month alone.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These innovative business models, built on solidarity within the industry and a unique understanding of web-traffic in the digital age, serve as models for already established medical marijuana companies as well as entrepreneurs looking to cash in on the so-called “green rush.” These advancements should appear as a boon in the eyes of weary investors, as they showcase the resilience of a medical marijuana movement that continues to thrive and innovate against all odds.</span></p><p><em>Lead image source: <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dm1TMimdhHM/maxresdefault.jpg" target="_blank">Google images</a></em></p>]]></content:encoded>			<wfw:commentRss>http://www.potbotics.com/against-all-odds-how-the-cannabis-industry-has-created-a-new-breed-of-advertising/feed/</wfw:commentRss>		<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>		</item>		<item>		<title>Canada Airs First National Marijuana Advertisement</title>		<link>http://www.potbotics.com/canada-airs-first-national-marijuana-advertisement/</link>		<comments>http://www.potbotics.com/canada-airs-first-national-marijuana-advertisement/#respond</comments>		<pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2016 18:25:54 +0000</pubDate>		<dc:creator><![CDATA[Timothy Bidon]]></dc:creator>				<category><![CDATA[Industry Insight]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[canada]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[canada cannabis]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[canada marijuana]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[cannabis]]></category>		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.potbotics.com/?p=1660</guid>		<description><![CDATA[The days of “Reefer Madness” are slowly coming to a close.

For evidence of this look no further than Canada, which found itself in the headlines this month when the group Cannabis Growers of Canada (CGC) aired a new television ad promoting cannabis production in the province of British Columbia.</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/482530368594281/videos/537164036464247/">The ad</a>, which currently boasts 1.8 million views on Facebook, is reminiscent of many other PR pushes by large industries. It’s complete with stock footage of beautiful natural landscapes in British Columbia, a feel-good acoustic guitar musical backdrop and, most importantly, a montage of smiling cannabis cultivators from Canada. The television spot marks a pivotal shift in how the world is beginning to interact with medical marijuana. In fact, the video boasts that cannabis cultivated in British Columbia is world-renowned for its taste and overall potency.</p><p>CGC hopes that this ad will help further <a href="http://blog.sfgate.com/smellthetruth/2016/04/12/watch-canadas-first-national-marijuana-advertisement/">sway public opinion</a> in Canada surrounding attitudes towards cannabis. Canada’s medical marijuana program differs from U.S. models in that only a small number of government-licensed cultivators are allowed to produce and supply marijuana directly to patients. Canadians are not allowed any sort of home cultivation.</p><p>The ad bodes well for many medical marijuana patients and advocates who seek to further normalize the concept of cannabis. Rather than portraying cannabis as an isolated fringe sector of the economy, the CGC ad hopes to convey a simple message: <a href="https://massroots.com/blog/watch-canadian-cannabis-ad-is-a-step-in-the-right-direction">Cannabis is for everybody.</a> The commercial stresses heavily cannabis’ role in job creation within the private sector.</p><p>With the election of liberal Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, our northern neighbors have moved rapidly and aggressively towards full legalization and normalization of cannabis as medicine. As we continue with the same goal here at home, perhaps more of us should look to Canada as a model.</p><p><em>Lead image source: Screenshot, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/482530368594281/videos/537164036464247/" target="_blank">Videos Worth Watching</a></em></p>]]></content:encoded>			<wfw:commentRss>http://www.potbotics.com/canada-airs-first-national-marijuana-advertisement/feed/</wfw:commentRss>		<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>		</item>		<item>		<title>Federal Government Offers New Guidelines for Doctors Regarding Testing Patients for Marijuana</title>		<link>http://www.potbotics.com/federal-government-offers-new-guidelines-for-doctors-regarding-testing-patients-for-marijuana/</link>		<comments>http://www.potbotics.com/federal-government-offers-new-guidelines-for-doctors-regarding-testing-patients-for-marijuana/#respond</comments>		<pubDate>Sat, 02 Apr 2016 16:19:51 +0000</pubDate>		<dc:creator><![CDATA[Timothy Bidon]]></dc:creator>				<category><![CDATA[Cannabinoids]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[Industry Insight]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[cannabis]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[CDC]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[chronic pain]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[government]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[marijuana]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[marijuana regulation]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[medical cannabis]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[medical marijuana]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[mmj]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[pain management]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[patient care]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[politics]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[public health]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[regulation]]></category>		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.potbotics.com/?p=1650</guid>		<description><![CDATA[It’s no secret that the Federal Government is trying to crack down on the prescription opioid addiction epidemic holding the United States in its grip.

Given mounting evidence that medical marijuana shows promise in reducing opioid-related deaths in states where it is legal, a new set of guidelines released by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is <a href="http://hightimes.com/read/federal-government-advises-doctors-against-testing-patients-marijuana">also advising doctors across the nation to stop testing their patients for marijuana. </a></p><p>This pivotal shift attests to the growing momentum behind the legalization movement that is, increasingly, gaining traction both within and outside of government institutions. This move by the CDC comes buried in a <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/rr/rr6501e1.htm">larger document explaining the guidelines </a>for prescribing opioids to patients experiencing chronic pain. The guidelines indicate that the CDC is now urging doctors to modify their drug screening policies so that a positive THC result in a urine test no longer disqualifies a patient from treatment. The agency, however, still stand behinds the practice of urine testing to gauge the presence of other “illicit substances,” though it specifically states that this rule should not longer apply to THC.</p><p>In the initial stages of care, patients are not typically subject to drug tests from their family practitioner to receive a pain medication prescription. The practice tends to occur, most often, in the transition between family practitioner to a larger pain management clinic. These facilities tend to hold patients to a higher standard before allowing them to continue their pain management plans. The new CDC guidelines argue, however, that maintaining these practices for THC only lead to a <strong>“stigmatization”</strong> and <strong>“inappropriate termination of care”</strong> which, they allege, may actually drive patients to seek out prescription-grade opioids through illicit means, thus contributing to the overall epidemic.</p><p><a href="http://www.painnewsnetwork.org/stories/2016/3/18/45g7l80k0vufyjyhb06z2ttgxdj3vk">The Pain News Network</a>, which played a pivotal role in seeing this provision written into the new CDC guidelines, also sites false positives as a major concern in THC urine testing for patients suffering chronic pain. According to their calculations, an estimated 21% of THC urine tests came back with either a false positive or negative result, respectively.</p><p>This move by the CDC marks continued progress for medical marijuana advocates in all aspects of the industry, but the work is far from over. Hopefully more government agencies follow the footsteps of the CDC in re-evaluating medical marijuana’s potential in pain management and, more broadly, re-evaluating the country’s failed “War on Drugs,” which remains the largest obstacle to a thriving, national, medical marijuana program.</p><p><em>Lead image source: <a href="http://healthimpactnews.com/2015/can-we-trust-the-cdc-british-medical-journal-reveals-cdc-lies-about-ties-to-big-pharma/">Health Impact News</a></em></p>]]></content:encoded>			<wfw:commentRss>http://www.potbotics.com/federal-government-offers-new-guidelines-for-doctors-regarding-testing-patients-for-marijuana/feed/</wfw:commentRss>		<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>		</item>		<item>		<title>States with Legal Marijuana See Reduction in Painkiller-Related Deaths</title>		<link>http://www.potbotics.com/states-with-legal-marijuana-see-reduction-in-pain-killer-related-deaths/</link>		<comments>http://www.potbotics.com/states-with-legal-marijuana-see-reduction-in-pain-killer-related-deaths/#respond</comments>		<pubDate>Mon, 28 Mar 2016 20:16:37 +0000</pubDate>		<dc:creator><![CDATA[Timothy Bidon]]></dc:creator>				<category><![CDATA[Cannabinoids]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[Industry Insight]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[addiction treatment]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[health]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[marijuana]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[medical marijuana]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[mmj]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[public health]]></category>		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.potbotics.com/?p=1640</guid>		<description><![CDATA[Could legalized medical marijuana be making a dent in painkiller-related deaths in America?

A new study published by the<a href="http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1898878" target="_blank"> Journal of the American Medical Association </a>indicates that in states with legalized marijuana, prescription painkiller deaths have reduced, on average, 20%.</p><p>According to the study, states with medical marijuana laws on the books had a 24.8% lower average annual opioid overdose mortality rate than states without any legal cannabis laws. The study, which took place over the course of multiple years, has proven a direct causative effect between medical marijuana laws and reduction in painkiller overdoses.</p><p>This new study gives further credibility to the growing consensus that medical marijuana should be considered a viable treatment for patients suffering from debilitating prescription painkiller addictions. A study conducted at <a href="http://blog.sfgate.com/smellthetruth/2015/07/27/marijuana-can-help-treat-opioid-addiction-study-shows/" target="_blank">Columbia University </a>in 2015 found that in their sample of 60 patients who have an opiate dependency, consumption of THC drastically reduced withdrawal symptoms and made the patients more likely to complete the 8-week addiction treatment regimen.</p><p>While more federal funding is desperately needed for medical marijuana to gain the traction it deserves in treating opiate addiction, studies like these indicate a continual shift in public opinion and understanding surrounding medical marijuana. Indeed, as many as <a href="http://blog.sfgate.com/smellthetruth/2016/03/03/painkiller-related-deaths-down-25-percent-in-legal-marijuana-states/" target="_blank">20 states are preparing to evaluate marijuana legalization </a>laws in 2016 alone.</p><p>This shift in opinion could not be coming at a more critical moment. As of last year, the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/overdose.html" target="_blank">Center for Disease Control</a> (CDC) estimates that, on average, 44 Americans die of prescription painkiller overdoses on a daily basis. In 2013, prescription drug overdose was the leading cause of injury death in America. It’s estimated that opioid addiction costs the American economy approximately $55.7 billion annually through lost productivity in the workplace, skyrocketing healthcare costs, and further criminal justice costs, as well.</p><p>It’s abundantly clear that prescription opioid addiction and overdose is now too large a public health issue to ignore. The scientific community is beginning to assert that medical marijuana could be among one of the solutions.

Rather than capping off a patient’s possession allowance in terms of ounces, Connecticut law dictates that patients are allowed to have a “one-month’s supply” of usable marijuana at any given time. Unlike many other states, Connecticut does not allow for any cultivation of marijuana by patients at home. Connecticut’s medical marijuana program allows for the operation of multiple state-licensed dispensaries and is only accessible to residents of the state. There are an estimated 4,914 patients registered in the state’s medical marijuana program.</p><p>Applications for medical marijuana cards are handled by <a href="http://www.ct.gov/dcp/cwp/view.asp?a=4287&amp;q=503670&amp;dcpNav=%7C">Connecticut’s Department of Consumer Protection</a>. The agency is one of few that also allows patients to apply for a medical marijuana card online. Patients seeking to enroll in the medical marijuana program must first see a physician for a medical marijuana evaluation and provide the department with documentation proving both residency and qualifying ailment. The department does not list any application fees outright.</p><p>As it stands, Connecticut’s medical marijuana program allows for 10 qualifying conditions with room for growth:</p><ul><li>Cachexia</li><li>Cancer</li><li>Crohn&#8217;s disease</li><li>Epilepsy</li><li>Glaucoma</li><li>HIV / AIDS</li><li>Intractable spasticity</li><li>Multiple Sclerosis</li><li>Parkinson&#8217;s disease</li><li>The Department of Consumer Protection reserves the right to approve more ailments.</li></ul><p>Patients with more questions can contact the Department of Consumer Protection via phone or email.</p><ul><li><a href="mailto:dcp.mmp@ct.gov">dcp.mmp@ct.gov</a></li><li>(860) 713- 6066</li></ul><p><em>Lead image source: <a href="https://rememberingletters.wordpress.com/2012/04/22/connecticut-capitol-building/">&#8220;Remembering Letters and Postcard&#8221;</a> via WordPress.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>			<wfw:commentRss>http://www.potbotics.com/how-to-get-a-medical-cannabis-card-in-connecticut/feed/</wfw:commentRss>		<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>		</item>		<item>		<title>How to Get a Medical Cannabis Card in Colorado</title>		<link>http://www.potbotics.com/how-to-get-a-medical-cannabis-card-in-colorado/</link>		<comments>http://www.potbotics.com/how-to-get-a-medical-cannabis-card-in-colorado/#respond</comments>		<pubDate>Mon, 08 Feb 2016 20:20:47 +0000</pubDate>		<dc:creator><![CDATA[Timothy Bidon]]></dc:creator>				<category><![CDATA[Cannabinoids]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[Cannabis Technology]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[Industry Insight]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[cannabis]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[Colorado]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[health]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[how to]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[marijuana]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[medical cannabis]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[medical cannabis card]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[medical marijuana]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[medical marijuana card]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[mmj]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[patient access]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[personalized medicine]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[politics]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[regulation]]></category>		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.potbotics.com/?p=1631</guid>		<description><![CDATA[Colorado was the first state to legalize marijuana for recreational purposes, but the state’s medical marijuana program has been on the books since 2001.

The state of California is known for its comparatively relaxed laws surrounding medical marijuana. In California, patients are not subjected to any specific possession limits, nor does the state have any limits surrounding home cultivation. California is unique because it doesn’t require any state registration, therefore accurate enrollment numbers are all but nonexistent. The California NORML chapter estimates medical marijuana enrollment anywhere between 750,000-1,125,000 patients. Medical marijuana in California is available to in-state residents only.</p><p>Because no statewide application process is required in California, residents can voluntarily apply for a county-issued medical marijuana card. Because of California’s relaxed marijuana laws, the state is home to a dense population of qualified physicians.

Patients residing in Arizona are allowed to possess a maximum of two and and a half ounces of marijuana at a time. Patients seeking to cultivate their own plants can only do so if they live beyond a 25-mile radius of a state-licensed dispensary, and they are allowed a maximum of 12 plants at any given time. The program stipulates that these plants must be kept in an “enclosed, locked facility.” An estimated 76,573 adults and 125 minors are currently registered in Arizona’s medical marijuana program. The state’s program also allows for state-licensed, not-for-profit dispensaries and has a limited reciprocity clause that allows qualified out-of-state residents access. Residents from other states must have one of Arizona’s qualifying ailments as well as an equivalent marijuana license from their home state.</p><p>Medical marijuana cards in Arizona are processed through the <a href="http://azdhs.gov/licensing/medical-marijuana/index.php">Arizona Department of Health Services.</a> Adult applicants must be over 18 years in age, while patients under 18 need a qualified caregiver to apply. The application process requires patients to fill out an attestation form as well as submit a medical marijuana evaluation from a licensed medical marijuana doctor. The cost of filing the application is $150.</p><p>In its current form Arizona’s program has 13 qualifying ailments:</p><ul><li>Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease</li><li>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Lou Gehrig&#8217;s disease)</li><li>Cachexia/ Wasting Syndrome</li><li>Cancer</li><li>Chronic pain</li><li>Crohn&#8217;s Disease</li><li>Glaucoma</li><li>Hepatitis C</li><li>HIV/ AIDS</li><li>Nausea</li><li>Persistent muscle spasms</li><li>PTSD</li><li>Seizures</li></ul><p>Patients seeking further information about how to apply for a medical marijuana card in Arizona can contact the Arizona Medical Marijuana Card Registry Office by phone or email.</p><ul><li><a href="mailto:M2programsupport@azdhs.gov">M2programsupport@azdhs.gov</a></li><li>(602) 364-1793</li></ul><p><em>Lead image source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Arizona">Wikipedia</a></em></p>]]></content:encoded>			<wfw:commentRss>http://www.potbotics.com/how-to-get-a-medical-cannabis-card-in-arizona/feed/</wfw:commentRss>		<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>		</item>		<item>		<title>How to get a Medical Cannabis Card in Alaska</title>		<link>http://www.potbotics.com/how-to-get-a-medical-cannabis-card-in-alaska/</link>		<comments>http://www.potbotics.com/how-to-get-a-medical-cannabis-card-in-alaska/#respond</comments>		<pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2016 17:34:34 +0000</pubDate>		<dc:creator><![CDATA[Timothy Bidon]]></dc:creator>				<category><![CDATA[Cannabinoids]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[Industry Insight]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[Medical Marijuana Selection]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[alaska]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[cannabis]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[cannabis patient]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[how to]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[how to get a medical marijuana card]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[legislation]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[marijuana]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[marijuana patient]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[medical cannabis card]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[medical marijuana card]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[medical marijuana doctor]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[medical marijuana evaluation]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[mmj]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[mmj card]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[politics]]></category>		<category><![CDATA[regulation]]></category>		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.potbotics.com/?p=1611</guid>		<description><![CDATA[In Alaska, medical marijuana laws have been on the books since 1998.

The program was designed to be among the most strict in the nation. Indeed, patients in Tennessee are only allowed limited amounts of cannabidiol (CBD) oil for limited ailments such as epilepsy. Furthermore, patients in Tennessee must surrender their driver’s licenses before enrolling in the medical marijuana program. Regardless of all this, the state’s medical program was regarded as a victory amongst advocates given that it was drafted and passed through a majority republican state house.</p><p>Now, another Tennessee republican who touts a “no-nonsense” approach to drug policy is the unlikely face leading a fight for <a href="https://blog.wheresweed.com/medical-marijuana/2015/dec/tn-legislator-pushing-for-medicinal-marijuana-use-for-ptsd">expanded access for veterans.</a> Jeremy Faison, a state legislator, has put a bill before the Tennessee legislature that would decriminalize marijuana possession for veterans suffering from PTSD. While the move is incremental, it’s making waves in the state.</p><p>Patients suffering from PTSD typically experience difficulty sleeping as well as disturbing nightmares that plague their mental health. Speaking to <a href="http://www.wcyb.com/news/tn-legislator-pushing-for-medicinal-marijuana-use-for-ptsd/36921778">The Tennessean</a>, Faison explained the reasoning behind his proposed bill: &#8220;I&#8217;ve spoken with many veterans who have fought for our country who have looked and know the side effects of prescription drugs. They know the side effects of alcohol, and they desperately want to be able to use the cannabis plant,&#8221; Faison said.</p><p>One of Faison’s most <a href="http://ivn.us/2015/12/22/new-tennessee-bill-decriminalize-pot-possession-vets-ptsd/">outspoken critics</a> is is Representative Sherry Jones, a democrat from Nashville. While she applauds Faison’s bill as a step in the right direction, Jones argues that it is unfair to single out such a small portion of the population. Instead, she advocates a broader scope of medical marijuana access in her home state, far beyond exclusively veterans with PTSD.</p><p>Despite her criticisms, Jones has indicated that she plans to support Faison’s bill anyway because, in her view, it is still incrementally more positive. Ultimately, what medical marijuana advocates hope to see in Tennessee is a broader dialogue surrounding the benefits of medical marijuana. Indeed, as this unlikely legislation shows, that dialogue is starting to take root.</p><p><em>Lead image source: <a href="http://truthinmedia.com/tenn-state-rep-draft-bill-decriminalizing-pot-possession-vets-ptsd/">Truth in Media</a></em></p>]]></content:encoded>			<wfw:commentRss>http://www.potbotics.com/tennessee-republican-advocates-cannabis-for-veterans-with-ptsd/feed/</wfw:commentRss>		<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>		</item>	</channel></rss>'
