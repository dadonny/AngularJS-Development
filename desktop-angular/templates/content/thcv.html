<div class="canabinoid-detail-info" style=""><p><strong>Tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV)</strong> is a psychoactive cannabinoid that strengthens the effects of THC. Patients who medicate with cannabis plants that are high in THCV tend to feel the effects much quicker than a plant with no THCV. In addition to hastening THC’s effects, THCV also reduces the longevity THC’s psychoactivity, which is useful for anyone who doesn’t want to be medicated for long stretches of the day.</p><p>THCV also helps promote a clear-headed euphoria that prevents patients from ever feeling bogged down or in a fog. For patients who need to focus, strains with THCV are typically recommended.</p><p>Another unique characteristic of THCV is that it actually is an effective appetite suppressant. Marijuana is popularly known to give patients “the munchies”, but  strains high in THCV can prevent food cravings and even reduce the rewarding sensations that come with eating unhealthy foods. Other studies show THCV to be a promising avenue for stimulating bone growth and preventing convulsions. </p><p style="margin: 0;">Medicinal Overview</p><ul><li>Clear-headed</li><li>Energetic</li><li>Hastens THC’s effects</li><li>Reduces the longevity of THC’s effects</li><li>Blocks rewarding sensation for eating unhealthy food</li><li>Anti-convulsive</li><li>Stimulates bone growth</li></ul></div>
