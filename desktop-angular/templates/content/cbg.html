<div class="canabinoid-detail-info" style=""><p><strong>Cannabigerol (CBG)</strong> is considered a “building block” cannabinoid, and it can usually only be found in trace amounts because it eventually converts into THC, CBD, and CBC. Even though CBG is responsible for the creation of a number of key cannabinoids, it provides powerful medicinal effects of its own.</p><p>For one, CBG has demonstrated to be particularly useful at treating patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Tests have shown that CBG can significantly reduce inflammation in the digestive tract. CBG also can aid glaucoma patients by draining excess fluid in the eye, which helps to reduce intraocular pressure. Patients who have anxiety will benefit from strains that are high in CBG because it helps inhibit GABA uptake in the brain. Inhibiting GABA promotes muscle relaxation, and it also works to treat depression.</p><p>Although CBG makes up a small portion of a cannabis plant’s overall cannabinoid profile, growers are figuring out ways to increase their CBG content in order to boost their plant’s therapeutic effects. As time goes on, expect to start seeing higher concentrations of CBG in marijuana soon.</p><p style="margin: 0;">Medicinal Overview</p><ul><li>Anti-inflammatory</li><li>Reduces ocular pressure</li><li>Relieves stress</li><li>Neuroprotectant</li><li>Inhibits cancerous tumor growth</li></ul></div>
