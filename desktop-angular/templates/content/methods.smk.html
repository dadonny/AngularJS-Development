When patients smoke cannabis, the plant gets burned at a temperature of roughly 2,000 degrees, which is not only painful on the lungs and throat, but it is also carcinogenic. Because of the extreme temperatures, some cannabinoids can be lost during the combustion process as well. Vaporizing, on the other hand, heats the plant to roughly 338 degrees fahrenheit, which produces a non-carcinogenic vapor considered by many patients to be soothing and pleasant. The low temperatures maximize efficiency and potency by extracting the plantâ€™s entire cannabinoid profile.</p><br/><table><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Rapid Relief</li><li>Active effects compared to edibles</li><li>Reliable results compared to oral mucosal and ingestion consumption methods</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Smoke is carcinogenic</li><li>Less efficient at extracting full cannabinoid profile compared to vaporizing</li><li>Odor</li><li>Hard to tell quality of pre-rolled joints</li><li>Psychotropic effects may not be practical for some patients.</li><li>More likely to cause insomnia than ingested cannabis</li><li>Patients who need sustained relief will need to re-medicate throughout the day.</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div></p>
