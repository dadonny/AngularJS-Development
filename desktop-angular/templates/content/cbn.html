When used as a topical, CBN has been shown to effectively treat patients with MRSA. Other studies suggest this cannabinoid can be used to dull pain, stimulate appetite, and reduce ocular pressure.</p><p>For almost every single cannabis plant, the most pervasive cannabinoid is THCA. When the plant gets heated to a high enough temperature, THCA converts into the plantâ€™s main psychoactive cannabinoid, THC. If cannabis plants are exposed to light and air for an extended period of time however, THCA converts to CBN instead, which produces the opposite effect. As a result, CBN is the primary product of THC degradation, so for patients who want to avoid their plant developing unintentionally sedative effects, it is important to properly store their medication in a dark area in an air-tight container.</p><p style="margin: 0;">Medicinal Overview</p><ul><li>Sleep Aid</li><li>Pain Relief</li><li>Appetite Stimulant</li><li>Antibacterial</li><li>Reduces ocular pressure</li><li>Promotes bone growth</li></ul></div>
