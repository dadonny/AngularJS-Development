Not only is CBD an excellent anti-inflammatory agent, it is also one of the most effective anti-anxiety and anti-epileptic medications currently available today.</p><p>All types of inflammation, including digestive disorders and arthritis, can be improved through cannabidiol based therapy. CBD is able to treat these ailments by activating CB2 receptors located throughout the digestive tract and other inflamed areas.</p><p>For anyone who suffers from anxiety, multiple studies have proven that CBD is capable of reducing stress by interacting with the limbic and paralimbic areas of the brain. CBD is also useful for anyone who wants to easily manage and control the euphoria of THC.</p><p>One of the most widely accepted uses of CBD therapy is to treat patients who suffer from debilitating, chronic seizures. CBD alone has been highly successful at reducing, and sometimes, even completely preventing seizures from patients who have either epilepsy or Dravet syndrome.</p><p>After the recreational market all but made CBD extinct, breeders are now scrambling to reintroduce this medicinal powerhouse back into their plants. What was once considered to be an unnecessary and undesirable cannabinoid just a few short years ago is now believed by many to be the single most important cannabinoid in the medical marijuana market today.</p><p style="margin: 0;">Medicinal Overview</p><ul><li>Prevents paranoia and schizophrenia</li><li>Reduces short-term memory loss associated with THC</li><li>Stops cancer from metastasizing</li><li>Anti-inflammatory</li><li>Stress reducer</li><li>Anticonvulsant</li><li>Pain reliever</li><li>Appetite suppressant</li></ul></div>
