<div class="canabinoid-detail-info" style=""><p><strong>Cannabichromene (CBC)</strong> is non-psychoactive cannabinoid that does not get the attention it deserves. Despite this fact, CBC does possess a number of medicinal qualities that make it an important part of a plant’s cannabinoid profile. This synergistic cannabinoid is known to relieve pain, reduce inflammation, kill bacteria, and even promote neurogenesis when effectively combined with other key cannabinoids.</p><p>For patients who are in pain and need help, CBC does offer pain relief by interacting with the central nervous system, but not as effectively as THC. Specificially, CBC is known to dull pain by interacting with proteins located throughout the spinal cord.</p><p>Other tests show that CBC can also reduce inflammation. What’s interesting is that CBC accomplishes this without directly interacting with CB1 or CB2 receptors. It’s believed that CBC interacts with endocannabinoids or other phytocannabinoids to produce these anti-inflammatory effects indirectly.</p><p>Patients who want an all-natural antifungal and antibacterial medication should consider using a CBC topical. Studies have shown CBC to be useful in treating patients with E. coli and staph.</p><p>Another unique trait of CBC is that, unlike opiates, it helps promote neurogenesis. CBC helps stimulate growth in the hippocampal region of the brain, the same area that’s responsible for a person’s spatial memory, overall memory, and behavior. </p><p style="margin: 0;">Medicinal Overview</p><ul><li>Anti-inflammatory</li><li>Anti-fungal</li><li>Pain-reliever</li><li>Stimulates bone growth</li><li>Anti-depressant</li><li>Neuroprotectant</li><li>Synergistic effect with other cannabinoids</li></ul></div>
