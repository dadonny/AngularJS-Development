Cannabis tinctures, sprays, and gum extract active cannabinoids from plant material in a similar fashion to how edibles are made, but instead of soaking cannabis leaves in butter or oil, they are soaked in alcohol. The solids are then finely strained, leaving behind a potent liquid that contains the plant’s full cannabinoid profile.</p><p>Cannabinoid compounds delivered sublingually (under the tongue) take effect quicker than if absorbed by the top of the tongue or through the roof of the mouth. However, all oral mucosal methods take effect faster than ingested cannabis, because unlike ingestion, the liver does not need to process the medication before entering the bloodstream. Patients usually feel the effects of oral mucosal medications within 15 to 60 minutes, and can expect them to last anywhere from 4 to 6 hours. As with other forms of consumption, it is best to start with a small amount and gradually increase the dosage until relief from symptoms is experienced.</p><br/><table><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Provides longer-lasting effects than inhaled cannabis</li><li>More “active” effects than edibles</li><li>Better at preventing accidental use than edibles</li><li>Dosages can be more easily controlled than infused edibles.</li><li>Provides rapid relief</li><li>Non-carcinogenic</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Unpleasant taste</li><li>High cost</li><li>Tincture’s potency can increase if alcohol evaporates.</li><li>More likely to cause insomnia than edibles</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div></p>
